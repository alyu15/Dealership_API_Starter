## Sales Contracts Controller
The user is able to utilize the GET and POST HTTP methods in order to retrieve any sales contracts in the database, 
as well as create a new sales contract to add to the database.

## Lease Contracts Controller

The user is also able to use the GET and POST HTTP methods in order to retrieve any lease contracts in the database. 
Similar to the sales contracts, the user will be able to add to the database by creating a new lease contract.

## Interesting Piece of Code

```
@PostMapping()
    public Vehicle addVehicle(@RequestBody Vehicle vehicle) {

        try {

            return vehiclesDao.create(vehicle);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Oops... our bad.");
        }
    }
```
I found this piece of code interesting because it contains such an important task of taking a whole entire vehicle
and adding it to the database but it does it in only a couple of lines of code. I understand that the method only requires
data entry from the user and calls the 'create' method from vehiclesDao but I found it very interesting how all these 
separate things can be tied together and be utilized here.
